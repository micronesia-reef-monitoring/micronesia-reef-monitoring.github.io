== Preamble

This site describes the repository contents available on github provided by the Micronesia Reef Monitoring (MRM) organization. MRM aims to make their software available to other organizations interested in accumulating data for their conservancy efforts.

MRM contains one primary repository, the [micronesia-ecology-database](). This repository contains the code for running a data-driven web application.

More to come

== Local Vagrant

The local vagrant repository contains a Vagrantfile and Ansible scripts which combined will run a local instance of the micronesia-ecology-database. It is also capable of using a Digital Ocean provider and deploying an instance there.

== WORK IN PROGRESS

There is still much to do!
